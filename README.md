# Laptop Price Determination Analysis
This project investigates the key factors influencing laptop prices to assist companies like Cityville Electronics in developing effective pricing strategies. By analyzing a dataset containing over 1,000 laptop entries, this study explores how variables such as processor tier, brand, number of cores, and RAM memory impact pricing.

## Project Overview
The primary research question addressed in this study is:
- **What are the most significant factors affecting laptop sales prices, and how do these factors interact?**
This project aims to provide actionable insights into the laptop market's pricing dynamics by examining technical specifications and brand value.

## Key Findings
1. **Processor Tiers**:
   - Higher-tier processors (i7, i9) significantly increase laptop prices.
   - Statistical significance confirmed with p-values < 0.001.

2. **Brand Reputation**:
   - Brands like Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo command premium prices.
   - Positive coefficients indicate the strong influence of brand recognition.

3. **Core Count and RAM**:
   - Higher core counts and larger RAM capacities correlate with higher prices, highlighting the market's valuation of performance.

4. **Model Fit**:
   - The final multiple linear regression model explains approximately **82% of the price variance** (RÂ² = 0.8216).
   - The F-statistic is highly significant (p < 2.2e-16), indicating strong model reliability.
