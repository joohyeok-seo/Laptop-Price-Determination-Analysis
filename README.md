# Laptop Price Determination Analysis

This project investigates the key factors influencing laptop prices to assist companies like Cityville Electronics in developing effective pricing strategies. Using a dataset of over 1,000 laptop entries, the study evaluates how variables such as processor tier, brand, core count, and RAM impact pricing dynamics.

## Project Overview
The study explores the following key question:
- What are the most significant factors affecting laptop prices, and how do these factors interact?

This analysis aims to deliver actionable insights into the pricing strategies of laptops by focusing on both technical specifications and brand value.

## Key Findings
1. **Processor Tiers**:
   - Higher-tier processors (e.g., i7, i9) significantly increase laptop prices.
   - Statistical significance confirmed with p-values < 0.001.

2. **Brand Reputation**:
   - Brands like Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo command premium prices, with positive coefficients indicating strong brand influence.

3. **Core Count and RAM**:
   - Higher core counts and larger RAM capacities correlate with increased pricing, reflecting performance valuation in the market.

4. **Model Fit**:
   - The final multiple linear regression model explains approximately 82% of the price variance (RÂ² = 0.8216).
   - The F-statistic is highly significant (p < 2.2e-16), demonstrating strong model reliability.
